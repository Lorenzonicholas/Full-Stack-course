To check if .net is installed just type  "dotnet" in the CMD
To check the version of dot net  type "dotnet --version"

Generating a new dotnet application
  - First, go to another drive except for the C drive 
  - inside the other drive type "new console -n coreConsoleProject"
  - The project will be generated
  - "code ." will open the VS code interface "D:\Dotnet Cousera\coreConsoleProject>code ."

* Inside the VS code console open a terminal  and type "dotnet build" This will create the project
  - PS D:\Dotnet Cousera\coreConsoleProject> dotnet build
  - A Bin file will be created 
  - the "dotnet run" command "PS D:\Dotnet Cousera\coreConsoleProject> dotnet run" runs the code and gives the out put eg: "Hello, World!"

*************************************************************************************************************************************************
* The following steps are commands used in the .NET CLI (Command Line Interface) to create, build, and run an ASP.NET Core web application. Here's a breakdown of each step:

  - Create a new ASP.NET Core web project

      "dotnet new web --name=coreWebProject"

This command creates a new ASP.NET Core web application.
"dotnet new web" specifies that the project type is a minimal API web project (without controllers or Razor pages).
"--name=coreWebProject" sets the project name to coreWebProject and creates a folder with that name.

  - Build the project

"dotnet build" This command compiles the application.
It checks for errors in the code and generates necessary files in the bin/ directory.
If there are any issues, they will be reported in the terminal.

  - Run the project

      "dotnet run"

This starts the web application.
The command runs the compiled application, launching the built-in Kestrel web server.
The terminal will display a URL (like http://localhost:5000), where the web app can be accessed.
